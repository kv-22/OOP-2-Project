# Pawfect Pets - A Pet Services Application

This project was developed collaboratively for the Object Oriented Programming course (2). The project builds a comprehensive pet services application integrated with the database where customers can create an account, purchase products, and book appointments while admins can manage the inventory and view orders.

**To run the project, do the following:**
  * Open the project in NetBeans.
  * Start the Derby server.
  * Create a new database called 'pawfect' with username and password both set to 'pawfect'.
  * Run the 'ScriptOOP.sql' file on the created 'pawfect' database connection.
  * Run the 'PetServicesApplication.java' file to start the program.
